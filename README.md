**Problem Statement:**
In today's fast-paced world, managing health appointments efficiently is crucial.
Imagine a platform that allows patients to seamlessly connect with doctors, book appointments, and keep track of their health consultationsâ€”all in one place.


**Inefficient Appointment Systems:** Current healthcare appointment management lacks efficiency, causing frustration for both patients and healthcare providers.

**Long Wait Times:** Patients often experience long wait times when trying to schedule or attend appointments.

**Missed Appointments:** High rates of no-shows disrupt healthcare workflows and lead to lost revenue for providers.

**Poor Communication:** A lack of streamlined communication between patients and doctors results in missed information, leading to delays in treatment.

HealthConnect is designed to solve the inefficienciesin health appointment scheduling,Management of patient records, and improving thepatient-doctor communication process.
It ensures a seamless, secure, and user-friendly platform for healthcare


In developing the health appointment platform, key challenges were encountered during backend and frontend integration, particularly with managing consistent data flow between APIs and the UI.Sending real-time updates, such as appointment confirmations, posed additional difficulties, as the system needed to synchronize actions instantly. Integrating a real-time chatbot for support further complicated the system, requiring the use of WebSockets or third-party services for seamless and responsive communication across the platform.
