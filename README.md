In developing the health appointment platform, key challenges were encountered during backend and frontend integration, particularly with managing consistent data flow between APIs and the UI.Sending real-time updates, such as appointment confirmations, posed additional difficulties, as the system needed to synchronize actions instantly. Integrating a real-time chatbot for support further complicated the system, requiring the use of WebSockets or third-party services for seamless and responsive communication across the platform.
